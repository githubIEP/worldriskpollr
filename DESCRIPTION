Description: Provides users with programmatic access to aggregated survey 
  data from the World Risk Poll, conveniently packaged for consumption by R users. 
  It first downloads and formats the Lloyd's Registry Foundation and Gallup World Risk Poll individual survey responses. It then
  processes this data and provides weighting functions for users to select questions
  of interest and aggregate to national levels, by gender, age, income, education
  urban/rural and household composition. The method of aggregation can be found <[https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx]https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx>
