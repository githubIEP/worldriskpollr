# worldriskpollr

The goal of this package is to provide you with easy, programmatic access to individual-level survey data from the World Risk Poll. The Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll provides us with the first ever complete picture of the differences between people's thoughts about, and experiences of risk. This insight will be used by regulators, businesses, governments and researchers to develop relevant and relatable policies that empower people to take action, that saves lives and help them feel safer.

Lloyd's Register Foundation teamed up with the Institute for Economics and Peace to examine the relationship between peace and perceptions of risk. This package was developed to enable further research on these important issues.
