# wrp

The goal of *wrp* is to provide you with easy, programmatic access to
individual-level survey data from the World Risk Poll. Lloyd’s
Register Foundation's World Risk Poll provides us with the first ever
complete picture of the differences between people’s thoughts on, and
experiences of, risk. This insight will be used by regulators,
businesses, governments and researchers to develop relevant and
relatable policies that empower people to take action, that saves lives
and help them feel safer.

Lloyd’s Register Foundation teamed up with the Institute for Economics
and Peace to examine the relationship between peace and perceptions of
risk. You can see our findings in the forthcoming 2021 Global Peace Index report. This
package was developed to enable further research on these important
issues.
